# quick_scan 
Quick Scan is a python based user input NMAP scanner that only requires the target parameters (i.e ip address/range - domain name) to generate all the NMAP scans for your engagement. This is a barebones version with simple user input to run the important nmap scans so feel free to copy and enhance to make a nmap scanner perfect for your needs.
